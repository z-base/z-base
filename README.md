# z-base

z-base is a future-proof, zero-knowledge, distributed backup, synchronization, and networking gateway, self-deployable on Cloudflare Workers, for real-time applications where privacy is the default, not an add-on.

z-base is a zero-knowledge state relay and persistence layer designed to make privacy-preserving web applications the default, not an afterthought.

It enables rich, real-time, offline-first applications without requiring service providers to process, store, or understand users’ personal data.
