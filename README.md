# Abstract
z-base specifies a zero-knowledge state relay and persistence API for browser-based JavaScript clients. It defines how encrypted, opaque state blobs are stored, relayed, and synchronized by a non-authoritative service, while all state validity, conflict resolution, and cryptographic verification are performed client-side. The specification guarantees offline-first operation, eventual consistency, and unlinkability of stored data, such that the service cannot interpret, correlate, or decrypt application state. This document defines the normative requirements for clients and base stations to interoperate within this model.
