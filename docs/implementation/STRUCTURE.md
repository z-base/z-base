Each folder must contain a unit test (.test.js) a README.md natural language intent and logical explanation, a module (index.ts || class.ts)

We must value consistent language, keeping concepts in full alingment across the codebase, in types, markdown, and variables/signatures

Code must be semantic it must explain its self to the reader via semantic naming
